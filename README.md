# Disclaimer
This project follows a tutorial on YouTube: https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8. \
In this project I learned about components, states, props, JSX, and practiced back-end REST api with Node.js and a mock JSON server.\
index.css was not covered in this video and was downloaded from a GitHub repository.


# Getting Started
Development Build\
'npm start' will start a local development build, localhost:3000

Back-End was created using JSON Server, found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server \
'npm run server' will start the local mock json server, localhost:5000


# About
This is a task tracker application.  The app is held within a single container which consists of a header, an add task button to toggle task input, and a list of tasks.\
Each Task consists of some text describing the task, a date/time, and a reminder toggled on/off.\
Through a mock JSON server, the state of your tasks is saved.\
